      <description>Tools #   nmap gobuster  Walkthrough #  First things first let&amp;rsquo;s scan the box. I used the command nmap -sV -sS $IP and redirected the output to the file nmap/nmap.txt. It looks like there is an http server on this box. Let&amp;rsquo;s try and connect to it to see if it is actually accessible. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like we can access it. Let&amp;rsquo;s run a gobuster scan on the domain to just see if we can access any other pages.</description>

      <description>Tools #   metasploit nmap  Walkthrough #  First things first. Let&amp;rsquo;s conduct a scan on the box using the command nmap -sS -sV -A $IP and pipe the output to the file nmap_out.txt. You can review the scan results there. Looking at the results the machine is running Windows 7 Professional 7601. If we google this version number we can find out that this version might be vulnerable to the &amp;ldquo;EternalBlue&amp;rdquo; (MS17-010) vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Tools #   nmap metasploit  Walkthrough #  First things first. Nmap scan. I used the command sudo nmap -sV -A -sS $IP then piped the output to nmap/nmap.txt. From the results it looks like there is a webserver open on port 8000 and port 5357. On port 800 there is an interesting software called Icecast running. Let&amp;rsquo;s do some research about this. It looks like Icecast is a software that allows a computer to be a media server.</description>

First things first. In order to find out google.com&amp;rsquo;s ip address we can use the ping command. This command just sends a little packet of data to google.</description>
